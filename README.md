# Mastering Microservices with Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, Docker & Kubernetes

This project is inspired by the course *"Master Microservices with SpringBoot, Docker, Kubernetes"*. It focuses on understanding microservices architecture and building production-ready applications using **Java, Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, Docker, and Kubernetes**.  

The project explores modern practices for scalability, security, monitoring, and deployment of cloud-native applications.
